# vue-film-library

> My first project written in Vue.JS + Firebase as first version. This is a simple web application, like classical todo-list, but mostly about films and serials.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
